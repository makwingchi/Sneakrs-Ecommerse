# Sneakrs E-commerse Website

An E-commerse website with ***Get OTP (one-time password)***, ***Log in***, ***Register***, ***View product list***, ***View product details***, and ***Create product*** features. It contains the promotion (limited-time offer) feature as well - the website will show how much time is left before a promotion, whether a product participates in limited-time deal, and if a product does, the customer will be able to get this particular item in a much lower price.
